Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a technical discipline within computer science focused on designing, implementing, evaluating, and managing software systems. Core principles include:

Reliability: Guaranteeing consistent, error-free performance in high-stakes domains like healthcare and finance.

Efficiency: Streamlining development processes to balance speed with robust quality control.

Scalability & Flexibility: Building systems that adapt seamlessly to growing demands without compromising functionality.

Security: Safeguarding data through protocols like encryption, access controls, and vulnerability assessments.

----

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Key Milestones in Software Engineering Evolution:

1968 NATO Conference=
The term "software engineering" was formally introduced, highlighting the need for systematic, disciplined approaches to counter the "software crisis" of unreliable and over-budget projects.

1980sâ€“1990s: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)-
Languages like C++ and Java popularized OOP, revolutionizing code organization through modular, reusable components (classes/objects), improving maintainability and scalability.

2001 Agile Manifesto- 
Prioritized iterative development, collaboration, and adaptability over rigid plans, reshaping workflows with frameworks like Scrum and Kanban to meet changing user needs.
------

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
